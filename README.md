# GeoSat-Algebra: Geometric and Conformal Algebra for Satellite Geometry and Pose Control

## 🚀 Overview

This repository explores the application of **Geometric Algebra (GA)** and its specialization, **Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA)**, as a powerful and unified mathematical framework for solving complex 3D geometry and transformation problems inherent in satellite systems and aerospace engineering.

By leveraging GA/CGA, we aim to demonstrate mathematically robust and computationally efficient alternatives to traditional methods (matrices, quaternions) for tasks such as:
1.  **Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS):** Using Rotors (versors) for singularity-free attitude control.
2.  **On-Orbit Collision Avoidance:** Efficient geometric calculation of distances and intersections using CGA blades.

## 🎯 Core Focus: CGA in 5D Space

The project focuses on implementing algorithms within $G(4,1)$—the 5D Conformal Geometric Algebra—which integrates translation, rotation, and scaling into a single algebraic structure, essential for dynamic optimization in satellite constellations.

## 💡 Key Advantages of GA/CGA

| Feature | Traditional Methods | Geometric Algebra (GA/CGA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unified Representation** | Requires separate data types for geometry (points, lines, planes) and algebra (vectors, matrices). | All geometric objects and transformations are unified as **Multivectors**. |
| **Transformation** | Separate operations for rotation (quaternions/matrices) and translation (vector addition). | All transformations are performed using the **Geometric Product** (versor multiplication), simplifying command sequences. |
| **Robustness** | Avoids issues like Gimbal Lock, crucial for real-time control systems. |

## 🛠️ Project Structure and Setup

All implementation code is contained within the `src/` directory. Each demo file is designed to be executable via Python command line and will output necessary visualization files (e.g., `.png` files) into the `5_Results_Analysis/` folder.

### Prerequisites

We recommend using a dedicated Conda environment.

```bash
# Create and activate the conda environment
conda create -n geo_sat_env python=3.10
conda activate geo_sat_env

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Repository Contents

| Directory/File | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/` | **Core Implementation:** Python scripts demonstrating GA/CGA concepts and their application to space geometry problems. | Initial Stage |
| `src/ga_utilities.py` | Helper module for defining fundamental GA/CGA types and custom operations based on `clifford`. | To Be Implemented |
| `src/satellite_geometry.py` | Classes and functions for defining satellite pose, orbits, and geometric relationships using CGA. | To Be Implemented |
| `5_Results_Analysis/` | Output directory for all visualization files generated by the demo scripts. | Ready |

## 🏃 Running the Demos

To run any demonstration, activate the environment and execute the file. Results (e.g., plots comparing a GA rotation vs. Matrix rotation) will be saved in `5_Results_Analysis/`.

### 1. GA Fundamentals (3D Rotation)

Demonstrates the Geometric Product and the use of Rotors in 3D Euclidean space ($G(3)$).

```bash
python src/demo_ga_3d_rotation.py
```

### 2. CGA Primitives (5D Objects)

Shows how Points, Lines, Planes, and Spheres are defined as multivectors in $G(4,1)$ and how they interact.

```bash
python src/demo_cga_primitives.py
```

### 3. Application: Collision Avoidance Geometry

A practical example demonstrating how CGA can calculate the closest distance between two spheres (satellites) or a sphere and a line (potential debris trajectory) using the meet and join operations.

```bash
python src/application_collision_avoidance.py
```

## 🔗 Future Research Paths (AI & Quantum)

This foundational geometry implementation is the first step toward advanced topics:

*   **AI/ML:** Utilizing stable CGA multivectors as input features for Reinforcement Learning agents controlling satellite attitude, aiming for faster and more robust convergence.
*   **Quantum Acceleration:** Mapping key CGA algebraic operations (Geometric Product, Meet/Join) onto Quantum circuits to explore computational speedups for large-scale constellation simulations.
